Craft.js is released under the [MIT license](https://github.com/prevwong/craft.js/blob/master/LICENSE) and is built with 100% love. Since it's first release in early 2020, it has been used by various individuals and companies to power their own page editor solution. 

In July 2022, I left my full-time job and in that time to focus on Craft and it's [future](https://github.com/prevwong/craft.js/issues/507). If you found this project useful and would like to ensure its continued development, please consider sponsoring/donating to the project. Your contribution would mean a lot to me!
